# Social Features (Staged)

## Phase 2 (Lean social)
- Publish itinerary snapshot (public)
- Public feed by area + vibe
- Like + bookmark
- No comments in Phase 2

## Phase 3
- Comments (short length)
- Report content
- Basic moderation tools

## Rationale
Comments require moderation/spam prevention; defer until core planner is stable.
Snapshots are required so shared itineraries remain valid even if APIs change.
