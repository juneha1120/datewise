# Product Spec

## Problem
Planning dates is time-consuming; people want a plan that fits time, budget, and walking tolerance, and feels "date-appropriate."

## Solution
Generate a cohesive date course using live venue/event data, optimizing for constraints and couple-friendly signals.

## Primary user flow
1) User sets inputs
2) System generates itinerary
3) User rerolls or swaps
4) User saves/share itinerary (Phase 2)

## V1 Non-goals
- Worldwide coverage
- Ticket purchasing
- Deep social network with comments (post-MVP)

## Itinerary templates
- Food: dinner -> dessert -> scenic (optional)
- Activity: main activity -> meal -> dessert
- Event: event -> nearby food -> dessert/scenic
- Scenic: sunset spot -> meal -> cafe/dessert
- Surprise: mixes based on availability + constraints
